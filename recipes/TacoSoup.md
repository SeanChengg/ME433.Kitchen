Crock-pot recipes are life savers for my family as we all have busy schedules. Here is one of my favorites.

- 1 Packet of Taco Seasoning
- 1 Can of Corn 
- 1 Can of Black Beans
- 1 46oz Bottle of Tomato Juice
- 1 Handful of tortilla/corn chips (We use Tostito's Scoops)

### Instructions
1. Brown the ground beef in skillet at medium heat
2. When finished, drain grease and add beef to crock-pot
3. Drain canned corn and add to crock-pot
4. Drain canned beans in colander and rinse with water, then add to crock-pot
5. Add tomato juice and taco seasoning to crock-pot
6. Cook on high for 5 hours
7. Crush chips in a bowl, add soup
8. Add any additional toppings of your choosing

Enjoy!

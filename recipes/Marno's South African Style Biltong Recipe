Biltong is a traditional South African snack made from air-dried beef or game meat. It has a distinctive flavor that comes from the spices used in the marinade, and it is a popular snack for hikers, campers, and sports enthusiasts. Biltong is also a great source of protein and is low in fat and carbohydrates, making it a healthy snack option.

### Ingredients:
- 2 kg of beef (sirloin or top round)
- 120 ml of vinegar
- 120 ml of Worcestershire sauce
- 2 tablespoons of coarse salt
- 2 tablespoons of coriander seeds
- 2 tablespoons of black pepper
- 2 teaspoons of bicarbonate of soda
- Butchers twine or string for hanging
- Optional: 2 tablespoons of paprika, 2 teaspoons of cumin, and 2 teaspoons of garlic powder

### Instructions:
1. Trim any excess fat off the beef, and then cut it into long, thin strips. The strips should be about 1.25 cm thick.

2. In a large bowl, combine the vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, coarse salt, coriander seeds, black pepper, and bicarbonate of soda. Optional: add paprika, cumin, and garlic powder to taste. Mix well.

3. Add the beef strips to the bowl, making sure that each strip is fully coated in the marinade. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and let it marinate in the refrigerator for 3 days, stirring the mixture occasionally.

4. Once the beef has marinated, remove it from the bowl and hang it up to dry. Tie each beef strip with butcher's twine or string, and then hang them in a well-ventilated area with low humidity, such as a garage or shed. Make sure the strips are spaced apart so they are not touching each other.

5. Let the biltong air-dry for 3-5 days, depending on the thickness of the strips and the humidity in your area. The biltong is ready when it is firm and dry to the touch and has lost 50% of its original weight.

6. Once the biltong is dry, remove it from the hanging string and store it in an airtight container. You can also vacuum-seal it for longer storage.

7. To serve, slice the biltong into thin strips and enjoy as a snack or appetizer.

Note: Air-drying meat carries a higher risk of bacterial contamination than oven drying, so it is important to use high-quality meat and to ensure that the meat is properly marinated and dried before eating. It is also recommended to use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of the meat to ensure it has reached a safe level.

Enjoy!

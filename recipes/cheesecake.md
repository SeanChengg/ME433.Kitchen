# Cheesecake Recipe

## Ingredients
**Graham Cracker Crust**
*   1 ½ cups graham cracker crumbs (170g)
*   2 Tablespoons sugar
*   1 Tablespoon brown sugar (can substitute white)
*   7 Tablespoons butter melted

**Cheesecake**
*   32 oz cream cheese² softened to room temperature (910g)
*   1 cup sugar (200g)
*   ⅔ cups sour cream (160g)
*   1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract
*   ⅛ teaspoon salt
*   4 large eggs room temperature, lightly beaten

## Instructions
**Graham Cracker Crust**
*   Preheat oven to 325F (160C).
*   Prepare Graham Cracker crust first by combining graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and brown sugar, and stirring well. Add melted butter and use a fork to combine ingredients well.
*   Pour crumbs into a 9” Springform pan and press firmly into the bottom and up the sides of your pan. Set aside.

**Cheesecake**
*   In the bowl of a stand mixer or in a large bowl (using a hand mixer) add cream cheese and stir until smooth and creamy (don’t over-beat or you’ll incorporate too much air).
*   Add sugar and stir again until creamy.
*   Add sour cream, vanilla extract, and salt, and stir until well-combined. If using a stand mixer, make sure you pause periodically to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl with a spatula so that all ingredients are evenly incorporated.
*   With mixer on low speed, gradually add lightly beaten eggs, one at a time, stirring just until each egg is just incorporated. Once all eggs have been added, use a spatula to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl again and make sure all ingredients are well combined.
*   Pour cheesecake batter into prepared springform pan. To insure against leaks, place pan on a cookie sheet that’s been lined with foil.
*   Transfer to the center rack of your oven and bake on 325F (160C) for about 75 minutes. Edges will likely have slightly puffed and may have just begun to turn a light golden brown and the center should spring back to the touch but will still be Jello-jiggly. Don't over-bake or the texture will suffer, which means we all suffer.
*   Remove from oven and allow to cool on top of the oven³ for 10 minutes. Once 10 minutes has passed, use a knife to gently loosen the crust from the inside of the springform pan (this will help prevent cracks as your cheesecake cools and shrinks).
*   Allow cheesecake to cool another 1-2 hours or until near room temperature before transferring to refrigerator and allowing to cool overnight or at least 6 hours. Enjoy!

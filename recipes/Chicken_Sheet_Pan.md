We’re back at it with the easy sheet pan dinners, and tonight we’re dressing up basic cauliflower and chicken with our latest favorite secret ingredient in this za’atar chicken sheet pan dinner.

### Ingredients
- Chicken thighs
- Olive oil
- Cauliflower
- Shallots
- Garlic cloves
- Salt

### Instructions
1. Coat the chicken thighs and cauliflower florets with some za’atar, salt and olive oil. Toss with a few shallots and spread it all out on a sheet pan.
2. Bake! Now you get to chill for 30 minutes.
3. While the chicken bakes, whisk together some za’atar oil—basically just oil, garlic, za’atar and salt.
4. When the chicken thighs reach an internal temperature of 165°, they’re done! Pull them out of the oven.
5. Drizzle with za’atar oil to finish, and then dig in.

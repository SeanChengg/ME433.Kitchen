## Charlie's Poached Eggs and Toast

A classic from my childhood. Makes three, but you can do two or four if you'd like.

### Ingredients
- 3 eggs
- 2 pieces of bread
- Butter
- Salt
- Pepper

### Instructions
1. Heat water in a medium sized pot to a boil.
1. Prepare eggs by cracking into a small bowl and gently dipping into the boiling water one at a time. (Be gentle to prevent the egg from exploding into a bunch of little egg bits)
3. Wait a couple minutes until eggs begin to firm (prod with a spoon)
4. In the mean time, toast the bread to your liking and butter as desired.
3. When done, scoop eggs onto the waiting toast. Take care to not split up each egg.
6. Salt and pepper to your liking.

To eat, cut into little squares, each with a good ratio of egg to toast.
Enjoy!

# Spanish Omelette Recipe

The Spanish omelette is a traditional dish from Spain. It is an essential part of the Spanish cuisine and culture and it is very simple to make. The omelette is made with eggs and potatoes with the option of including onion. 

## Ingredients

*   500g new potatoes
*   1 onion, preferably white
*   150ml extra-virgin olive oil
*   6 eggs

## Method

1.  Scrape the new potatoes or leave the skins on, if you prefer. Cut them into thick slices. Chop the onion.

1. Heat the extra-virgin olive oil in a large frying pan, add the potatoes and onion and stew gently, partially covered, for 30 mins, stirring occasionally until the potatoes are softened and golden. Strain the potatoes and onion through a colander into a large bowl (set the strained oil aside).

1. Beat the eggs separately, then stir into the potatoes with plenty of salt and pepper. Heat a little of the strained oil in a smaller pan.

1. Tip everything into the pan and cook on a moderate heat, using a spatula to shape the omelette into a cushion.

1. When almost set, invert on a plate and slide back into the pan and cook a few more minutes.

1. Slide on to a plate and cool for 10 mins before serving.

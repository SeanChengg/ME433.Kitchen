My favorite pasta sauce combines the best of both worlds, with a touch of freshness.

### Ingredients
- 1 teaspoon salt
- Your preferred spices mix OR garlix powder, black pepper, cumin, paprika
- Butter
- Extra Virgin Olive Oil
- Diced oignon 
- small cherry tomatoes cut in half
- Galic clove smashed
- Pesto Sauce (market bought, or homemade)
- Alfredo Sauce (market bought, or homemade)
- Grated Gouda cheese (or your favorite cheese)
- Your favorite pasta (technically not pasta, but can use egg wide noodles because they absorb lots of flavor)

### Instructions
1. Add olive oil to a pan, add oignon and garlic, and let cook for a couple of minutes
2. Add the diced cherry tomatoes, and cover the pan with a lid. Let cook for 10 minutes on low to medium heat. Stir occasionally to avoid burning/sticking. 
3. Smash the tomatoes once cooked, until the result almost resembles a sauce.
4. Add Pesto and Alfredo Sauces, quantities depend on your preferences. I use 2 teaspoons of pesto, and a cup of alfredo.  
5. Mix well until coherent and add your grated cheese. Cover with the lid for 2 minutes.
6. Add your final sauce and a teaspoon of butter to your cooked pasta, mix well and enjoy!

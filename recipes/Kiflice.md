Simple and small pastry filled with nutella that we eat often in the Balkans, every bakery has it. Also across other parts of Europe. It is not a croissant.

### Ingredients

#### Dough
- 3 tsp of sugar
- 1 cube fresh yeast
- 500g of flour
- 100ml of oil
- 1 tsp of salt
- 1 egg yolk

#### Filling
- Nutella or Eurocrem (personal choice on quanity, overfilling might spill out in oven)

#### Coating
- 1 egg yolk
- dash of milk

### Instructions
1. In a bowl, mix in yeast, sugar and salt.
2. In second bowl, add around half of the flour, and section out a hole in the center.

4. Start mixing with wooden spatula.
5. Periodically add the rest of the flour to the mix, and knead the dough with your hands.
6. Split created dough into 3 even parts and roll each into a ball.
7. Flatten the ball with a rolling pin and split into 8 parts as if you were cutting a pizza.
8. Add filling in each triangle at its center.
9. Bend widest sides into itself, so the filling doesn't spill out, and roll the kiflice forward into shape.
10. Prepare wax paper onto baking pan and start placing all of your kiflice on it. Don't place too close since they will lift. 
11. Cover the baking pan with a cloth and let them rest for 45 minutes.
12. Turn oven on to 180C.
13. Prepare coating, just mix in together, and cover each kiflica with the coating.

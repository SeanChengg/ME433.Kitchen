## How to make the perfect Swiss Cheese Fondue
I am Klemens Iten (a.k.a. Bakeey on Github), an exchange student from ETH Zurich in Switzerland. 
Without a doubt, a traditional cheese fondue is a staple of Swiss cuisine, so I will tell you how to make one. 
It's more than just melted cheese, you see!

### Ingredients (will feed 4-6 people)
- 1 clove of garlic
- 1 kg of Swiss cheese, preferably a mixture of 
[Emmentaler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmental_cheese) and 
[Gruy√®re](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gruy%C3%A8re_cheese)
- 500 ml of dry white wine (exact type is highly debatable, but I prefer a typical Swisss _Chasselas_)
- 50 ml of brandy, I prefer [Kirsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirsch)
- 1 tablespoon of corn starch
- some salt, pepper and nutmeg to taste
- enough bread for _n_ people, such as sourdough or baguette

### Instructions
1. Cut the garlic clove in half and rub it against the pot, so that the entire pan is covered in garlic
   (will stop the cheese from sticking to pot!)
2. Then squeeze the clove of garlic and heat it with the finely chopped (or shaved) cheese and the wine over medium heat
 in the fondue pot on the stove, stirring constantly, until it becomes a smooth cream.
3. Then whisk together the corn starch and the brandy, stir into the mixture and bring it to the boil again briefly.
4. Finally, season to taste with salt, pepper and nutmeg.
5. The pot is now served over a burner. Serve with bread cut into cubes.
6. Dip the bread into the melted cheese mixture with a fork. 
 This is best enjoyed with a nice, refreshing Swiss white wine
 (my favorite is _Aigle Les Murailles_ from the Vaud region in Switzerland).

Have a great meal!

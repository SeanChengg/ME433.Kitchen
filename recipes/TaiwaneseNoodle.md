This dish just always hits the spot. Also super easy to make--uses typical chinese ingrediants. Any other vegetables may also be added on top.

### Ingredients
This creates 4 servings
- 1 pound wheat or egg noodles
- 1/2 cup chicken broth
- 2 tablespoons dark soy sauce or oyster sauce
- 2 teaspoon light regular soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon Chinese black vinegar or young balsamic vinegar
- 1/2 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons cooking oil
- 1/2 onion chopped
- 1 pound ground pork or ground beef/chicken/turkey
- 2 cloves garlic finely minced
- 1 stalk green onion chopped
- 8 ounce can bamboo shoots drained and diced (optional)
- 4 ounces fresh shiitake mushrooms diced (optional)

### Instructions
1. Cook the noodles or rice according to package instructions. Drain.
2. In a small bowl, combine the chicken broth, dark soy sauce, regular soy sauce, vinegar, five spice powder and brown sugar. Set aside.
3. Heat a wok over medium-high heat. When hot, swirl in the cooking oil. Add in the onion and cook for 1 minute. Stir in the ground meat and cook for 2 minutes. Push aside the onion and ground beef to one side of the wok to create a small spot to fry the garlic. Add in the garlic and stir fry for a few seconds or until you begin smelling the garlic. Add in the bamboo shoots and mushrooms. Toss everything in the wok together.
4. Pour in the broth/soy sauce mixture and bring to a simmer. Cook for 2 minutes. Stir in the green onions. Serve the ground beef mixture over the noodles or rice.

Enjoy!

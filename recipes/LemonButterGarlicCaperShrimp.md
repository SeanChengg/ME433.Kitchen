### Instructions
1. Cover pan in olive oil and set to the highest setting
2. Saute the shrimp for about a minute and sprinkle with salt
3. Flip after a minute and cook for another minute
4. Add the garlic and stir for about a minute
5. Add the lemon juice and caper brine
6. Add the parsley and red pepper
7. Add 1/2 tbsp of butter and cook for about a minute
8. When the butter melts, reduce to low and add the remaining butter

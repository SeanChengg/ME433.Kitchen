These are pretty close to your run-of-the-mill chocolate chip cookies, but with some little tweaks that make them better. Recipe by Conor Shanley (git ces2711).

### Ingredients
- 2 1/4 cups AP flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 2 tsp coarse salt
- 2 sticks unsalted butter
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 3/4 cup brown sugar
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/4 tsp cinnamon
- 2 eggs
- 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
- 1 cup butterscotch chips

### Instructions
1. Brown butter (look this up on youtube or something) and refrigerate until re-solidified but still soft.
2. Preheat broiler; line cookie sheet with parchment paper.
3. Combine flour, salt, and baking soda in a small bowl.
4. Thoroughly combine butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla in large bowl using electric egg beaters.
5. Add the eggs to the butter and sugar mixture, mixing thoroughly but not over-mixing.
6. Gently fold in the dry ingredients, chocolate chips, and butterscotch chips.
7. Form ~1.5" balls from the dough and place on cookie sheet.
8. Broil the cookies on high until the tops are browned, about 1-2 minutes.
9. Remove cookies from oven, and reset the oven to bake at 375 degrees.
10. Once up to temperature, bake the cookies to your desired doneness, about 11-13 minutes.

Enjoy!

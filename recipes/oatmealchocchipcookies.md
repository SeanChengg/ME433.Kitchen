### Ingredients
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter
- 1/3 cup granulated sugar
- 2/3 cup light-brown sugar
- 2 tsp pure vanilla extract
- 1 large egg
- 1 1/2 cups rolled oats
- 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips

### Instructions
1. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour and baking soda; set aside.
2. Combine the butter with both sugars; beat on medium speed until light and fluffy.
3. Reduce speed to low; add the salt, vanilla, and eggs. Beat until well mixed, about 1 minute.
4. Add flour mixture; mix until almost combined.
5. Stir in the oats and chocolate chips. Chill dough for one hour to overnight.
6. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
7. Use a small ice cream scooper (two tablespoons) to Drop heaping tablespoon-size balls of dough about 2 inches apart on baking sheets lined with parchment paper.
8. Bake until cookies are golden around the edges, but still soft in the center, 8 to 10 minutes.
9. Remove from oven, and let cool on baking sheet 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack, and let cool completely.

Smacznego!

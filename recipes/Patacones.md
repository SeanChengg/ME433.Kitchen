# Recipe for Patacones
These are a recipe for fried plantains, as traditionally made in Colombia. I've also heard them called Tostones. 
They're a great appetizer or side, add a sausage and it's a whole meal.

# Ingredients:
- 1 Plantain per person on avg.
- Vegetable oil
- 2 garlic cloves
- Salt

## Steps:

1. Grab skillet and fill skillet with a lot of oil, like a mm thick. Put to warm
2. Add the cloves of garlic, sliced to slices
3. Cut into plantain peel lengthwise and discard peel. Slice it into chunks
4. Add chunks to warm oil and begin to fry until a light golden color. Don't let them stick.
5. Flip until color is even. Don't let the garlic burn, pull them out.
6. Pull them out of oil and squish. They'll be delicate now
7. Put them back into oil until they're a darker shade of gold, Maybe hints of brown lines, nd firm
9. Pull them out, they're done. Salt to taste

## Homemade Vanilla Pudding
<!---

A friend of mine had a crockpot for 3 years and never used it so I asked if I could give it a try. I was hoping to make better chicken with less effort. It worked out really well and I'm a huge fan! The amount of ingredients is pretty variable depending on how many people you want to serve. 

### Ingredients
- 3 cups whole milk, divided
- 3 tablespoons cornstarch
- Pinch of salt
- ¾ cup sugar
- 3 egg yolks
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

### Instructions
1. In a small bowl, whisk together ¼ cup of the milk with the cornstarch. Set aside.
2. In a medium saucepan, whisk together the remaining milk, salt, and sugar. Allow the mixture to heat over medium heat until it is steaming; do not let it boil.
3. While the milk heats, whisk the egg yolks in a separate small bowl. Once the milk is steaming, slowly stream ½ cup of the hot milk mixture into the egg yolks, whisking constantly. Slowly add the egg yolk mixture back to the pot, followed by the cornstarch mixture. Continue to cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture starts to simmer and has thickened.
4. Remove from the heat and whisk in the butter and vanilla. 
5. Pour into individual serving dishes. Top each with a layer of plastic wrap touching the top of the pudding to prevent a skin from forming and serve warm or allow to chill for several hours before serving.

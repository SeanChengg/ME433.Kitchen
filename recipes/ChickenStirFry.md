## Chicken Stir Fry

This is a great meal for college students as the left overs are just as delicious as out of the pan.

### Ingredients
- 4 cups water
- 2 cups white rice
- 2/3 cup soy sauce
- 1/4 cup brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon minced ginger
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 3 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, thinly sliced
- 2 tablespoons sesame oil
- 1 head broccoli, broken into florets
- 1 onion, cut into large chunks
- 1 cup sliced carrots

### Instructions
1. Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender, and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, combine soy sauce, and brown sugar in a medium glass or ceramic bowl; stir until smooth. Stir in ginger, garlic, and red pepper flakes; add chicken and stir to coat. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes.
3. Heat 1 tablespoon sesame oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add broccoli, onion, and carrots; cook and stir until just tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer vegetables into a dish; set aside.
4. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon sesame oil in the same wok or skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken, reserving marinade, and cook until just browned, about 2 minutes per side; stir in vegetables and reserved marinade. Bring to a boil; cook and stir until chicken is no longer pink in the center and vegetables are tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Serve over rice.

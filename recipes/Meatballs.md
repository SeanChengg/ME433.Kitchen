## Malachi's Meatballs

This is the recipe my mom would use to make meatballs for many occasions, but often for high school booster events. This recipe can also be found on the back of the Heinz chili sauce bottle, but that doesn't make it any less of a treat.

### Ingredients
- 1 bag, beef meatballs (Italian style also works but the flavor is a bit off)
- 1 can, cranberry sauce (I prefer to get the can without the whole berries, but you do you)
- 1 bottle, Heinz chili sauce

### Instructions
1. Dump everything into a slow cooker and cook until the meatballs are hot throughout, stirring occasionally (around 90 minutes on high for an Instant Pot)
2. Eat waaaaay too many by themselves, or with bread

This is one of the easiest and still "homemade" things to bring to a gathering. Guaranteed success (unless vegan).

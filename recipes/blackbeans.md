## Ely's Spicy Black Beans

This is a recipe I have made for many years, edited, and lived off through undergrad. It is delicious and can be served as a main or side dish, or as part of tacos, etc. You can also make the beans by soaking them the night before and cooking them in a pot if you don't have a pressure cooker. It can also easily be made vegan or vegetarian.
Keeps well in the fridge!

##Ingrediants
- 1 lb dry black beans
- 3 cups of chicken stock
- 1 sweet onion, diced
- 4 garlic cloves smashed with the back of a knife
- 1 jalepeno, sliced, seeded if preferred
- 1 bell pepper, diced
- 1 stalk of celery, diced
- 1 large tomato, diced
- 2 tablespoons olive oil (sometimes I also go for butter!)
- 2 teaspoons cumin
- 1 tablespoon chili powder
- 1 teaspoon smoked or sweet paprika
- 2 teaspoons salt, more to taste
- 1 teaspoon black pepper, more to taste
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 teaspoon dry oregano
- 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon (optional, but I never leave it out)
- cheese, avocado, cilantro, hot sauce, etc. for topping

##Instructions
1. In the bottom of an electric pressure cooker, sautee the onion, celery, and garlic until fragrant and onion is softened around the edges
2. Add the rest of the vegetables and continue to sautee until just softened.
3. Once the onion is translucent and very soft, add all of the spices and beans, sautee for just a minute more to coat everything.
4. Add the broth. Stir to combine. You can give it a taste at this point to see if it needs some more salt or pepper.\
5. Seal the pressure cooker and cook on high for 25 minutes. Allow the pressure to release naturally.
6. If you'd like the beans to be a bit more soupy, you can add some more broth and bring to a boil.
7. Taste again for salt and pepper.
8. Serve with rice, cheese, avocado, cilantro, fresh onion and jalepeno, whatever your heart desires!

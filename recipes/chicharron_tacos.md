## BB's Chicharron Tacos (Bryanna)

This is a recipe to make chicharron tacos, a mexican dish. Chicharron is spanish for fried pork rinds. It can make around 8-10 tacos. I thought I would share since not many people have tried it or heard of this dish and it is very yummy although probably not that healthy. The tacos are usually eaten with an accompanying avocado salsa but this recipe is just for the tacos themselves. 

> Caution: this recipe is spicy! It can be made less spicy though

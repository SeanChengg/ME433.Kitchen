# Aaron's Simple Salmon Bites Recipe
I'm not a good cook at all, but this is a simple recipe that I use if I want to get some yummy protein in my meals. 

## Ingredients
Note: I usually eyeball the amount of seasoning I use, so I do not have any particular quantities for them!

*  1 lb salmon fillet without skin
* Salt
* Pepper
* Garlic powder
* Olive oil

## Instructions
1. Preheat the air fryer to 400F, if your air fryer needs to preheat. If not, proceed with step 2.
2. Cut the salmon fillet into even 1 to 1.5 inch cubes. 
3. Pour the salmon cubes into a medium-sized bowl. 
4. Pour a generous amount of salt, pepper, olive oil, and garlic powder into the bowl (Make sure each cube has seasoning on it).
5. Mix the salmon and the seasoning together in the bowl (I tend to use my hands).
6. Place a sheet of aluminum foil on the air fryer tray.
7. Place salmon cubes onto the tray and air fry for 5-6 minutes, or until fully cooked. 

Enjoy!

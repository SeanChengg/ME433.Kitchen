### Instructions
1. Mix the sugar, egg yolk together in a small pan
2. Pour the cream milk slowly while warming the pan
3. Add the vanilla extract into the pan as well
4. Stir until the mixture reaches 75 celcius degrees
5. Pour the mixtures into cups
6. Preheat the oven to 375F
7. Fill some water into a large plate
8. Put the cups into the plate 
9. Bake for 20 minutes
10. Put the cups into the fridge for 2 hours

Enjoy!

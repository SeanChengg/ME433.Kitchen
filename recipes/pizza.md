This pizza takes around 30 hours to make start-to-finish, great for impressing people with your absurd dedication to pizza. Makes 4 medium pizzas.

### Ingredients
#### Poolish
- 200g warm water
- 5g honey
- 5g active dry yeast
- 200g all-purpose flour

#### Dough
- 300g bread flour
- 300g water
- 20g salt
- 200g all-purpose flour
- extra flour
- olive oil
- Desired toppings and sauce

### Instructions
#### To make the poolish:
1. Add honey and yeast to water in a storable container, mix
2. Mix in flour
3. Let sit for 15 minutes
4. Cover and let sit for 1 hour at room temperature
5. Put in fridge for 16-24 hours (no more than 24 hours)

#### To make the dough:
1. Take out poolish from fridge and let sit 1 hour at room temperature
2. Add poolish and manitoba flour to a large mixing bowl, begin to mix
3. In a separate bowl or measuring cup, mix water and salt
4. Add all-purpose flour to poolish
5. Little by little, add salt water mixture to dough while mixing until all water has been integrated. Dough should be wet and sticky.
6. Pour dough out onto a flat surface and work dough with 2 hands until there are no chunks of flour and dough starts to come together (will still be sticky).
7. Form together and pat the top with a light coating of olive oil.
8. Let rest for 15 minutes.
9. Gently form dough into a ball and pat with olive oil again.
10. Cover with a towel and let sit at room temperature for 1 hour.

#### Shaping the dough:
1. Cut dough into 4 parts.
2. For each piece, gently fold in bottom of dough to make a ball (do not knead, leave top of dough intact)
3. Place dough on a baking sheet or plate and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let sit for 1-2 hours.
4. Sprinkle flour over top of dough, transfer to floured surface.
5. Press center of dough so that a crust shape forms. Flip dough and press from other side.
6. Holding down one edge of the dough, lightly pull on the opposite side to stretch out dough, leaving a thicker area for the crust at the edge. Rotate and repeat until dough is thin in the center with a significant crust around the edge.

#### Toppings and baking:
1. Preheat oven to maximum temperature. For best results, use a pizza stone or (even better) a pizza oven.
2. Prepare toppings.
3. Add thin layer of sauce to pizza dough.
4. Add cheese and toppings. To prevent toppings such as basil from burning, coat topping with a thin layer of oil.
5. Cook in hot oven for a few minutes, rotating if need. Pizza will cook fast.

If you've made it this far, enjoy!

Who doesn't love fries, especially from McDonald's. 

#### Ingredients

*   Russet Potatoes
*   Canola Oil

##### Instructions

1.  The potatoes are washed and peeled by machines.
2.  Workers hand-cut any imperfections off the potatoes.
3.  The fries shoot through a tube at about 75 MPH through cutting machines.
4.  Optical strips look at every single fry and remove any with a fault.
5.  They are blanched in precisely maintained 170° water for about 15 minutes to allow for a soft interior.
6.  The fries are completely dried.
7.  They are then quickly fried for the 1st time at 400° F.
8.  From here, they go into a freezer at 10°F.
9.  Once frozen, they are shipped to restaurants.
10. Once at the restaurant, they are fried for a second time, salted, and served.

Enjoy!

## Anna's Rice and Beans

Beans are a super food. Rice is delicious and tumeric turns it a fun yellow color. Neither cost more than a couple dollars. What's not to like?

### Ingredients

- 1 cup long grain rice / jasmine rice / whatever you have
- 2 cans black beans
- 2 cups vegetable broth
- 1 poblano pepper
- spices (suggested): tumeric, paprika, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder
- salt
- sriracha
- sour cream
- lime
- pico de gallo
- butter

### Instructions
 
Heat a sauce pan on medium heat. Melt 2 tbsp of butter. If using fresh garlic, mince and stir into butter. Add about half a tsp of tumeric and a tsp of the other spices. Once spices are combined with butter and everything smells good, stir in rice to coat with the butter and spices. Stir in vegetable broth and bring to a simmer, then cover and continue simmering until the liquid is absorbed. 

While the rice simmers, coarsely dice the poblano pepper. Drain most of the liquid from the canned beans and dump into another sauce pan. Add in the pepper and about a quarter cup of vegetable broth and bring to a boil. Add cumin, garlic powder, chili powder, and salt to taste. Continue to boil until the rice is done or too much of the liquid is gone. 

Mix sour cream and sriracha to taste. Stir in lime juice, salt, garlic powder, and anything else that seams interesting. 

Serve rice and beans with pico de gallo and the sour cream mixture.

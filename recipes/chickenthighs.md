## Johnny's Fast Chicken Thighs

Actual cooking is difficult, but tossing a piece of chicken into the air fryer is pretty easy.

### Ingredients
- 4 Bone in, skin on chicken thighs, trimed of excess fat and skin
- ½ teaspoon Kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon Smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon Garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon Oregano
- ½ teaspoon Onion powder

### Instructions
1. Preheat your air fryer to 380F for 5 minutes. After pre-heating, spray with cooking spray.
2. Add the chicken thighs to a large zip-top bag or a bowl with a lid. Top with the kosher salt, smoked paprika, garlic powder, oregano and onion powder. Shake to coat.
3. Place the chicken thighs in the air fryer, skin side down, for 12 minutes.
4. Turn your chicken thighs skin side up and cook for 10 minutes more. If you would like your chicken thighs super crispy. Cook for 4 minutes increments to get your desired crispness.
5. Thighs are done when an internal meat thermometer reads 165F. Serve.

Enjoy!

# Crockpot Chicken Tacos

## Ingredients & Materials

* 4 Chicken Breasts
* 1 Taco Seasoning Packet
* 1 Jar of Red Salsa
* The Juice of 2 Limes

You will need a crockpot and either two forks or a hand mixer. 

## Instructions
1. First put all of the chicken breasts into the crockpot, uncut.
2. Coat the chicken breasts with the taco seasoning packet. Cover both sides evenly. 
3. Pour the salsa and lime juice over the tacos, and use tongs to again coat both sides of the breasts evenly. 
4. Cook the chicken for 8 hours on the low setting. 
5. When done cooking, use a hand mixer on low speed to shred the chicken breasts. This can also be done with two forks. 
6. Enjoy!

I prefer to serve mine with some regular store bought tortillas, diced avocado, sour cream, and cheese. They're quite flavorful, 
so they don't need a lot of help.

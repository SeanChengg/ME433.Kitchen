My favorite breakfast meal is the Venezuelan dish arepas which uses maize dough, cheese, and butter.

### Ingredients
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 5/2 cups of lukewarm water
- 2 cups of white cornmeal
- 3 mozarella cheese slices
- 1 teaspoon of butter
- 1/4 vegetable oil

### Instructions
1. Pour the water into a bowl and add salt.
2. Add the cornmeal until a soft, malleable dough forms. 
3. Split the dough into several parts with the circumference of a hamburger and thickness of a slice of bread.
4. Add the vegetable oil to the pan and heat for a minute or two.
5. Add the uncooked arepas to the pan and wait about 10 minutes for them to cook.
6. Slice open each arepa and then add cheese and butter. 

Enjoy!

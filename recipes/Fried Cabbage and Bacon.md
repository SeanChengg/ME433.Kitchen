<!---

From my experience, greens generally don't have a particularly long life in your refrigerator, but cabbage lasts for a pretty long time. Something about it's low water content or something like that. Regardless, here's a simple recipe that makes use of those long-lasting heads. No real specifics here, everything is to personal taste.

### Ingredients
- 1/2 head cabbage
- 1/2 pack of bacon
- Salt
- Pepper
- (Optional) Cooking oil of choice

### Instructions
1. Roughly cut bacon into 1 inch long pieces.
2. Core cabbage and cube.
3. Heat large pan on stove. Once sufficiently hot, put bacon pieces into pan.
4. Cook bacon until crisp and remove from pan, retaining the bacon grease. If the quantity of grease in the pan is insufficient for the cabbage, add cooking oil as needed. Set bacon aside.
5. Reheat grease/oil to temperature and put cabbage into pan. Stir continuously, breaking up the cabbage and coating the cabbage in oil.
6. Stir and cook for a few minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Continue cooking until desired texture is achieved.
7. Just before removal from pan, return bacon to pan and reheat.
8. Remove cabbage and bacon from pan and serve.

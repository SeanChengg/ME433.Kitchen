This recipe is a traditional Quebecois dish that will make about 12 vol-au-vents. These delicate puff pastry shells are filled with a creamy chicken and carrots mixture, making for a delicious and elegant appetizer or main course.

### Ingredients
**Vol-au-vent**
- 2 cups chicken broth
- 1 diced onion
- 3 diced carrots
- 2 diced chicken breasts (about 1.5 lbs)
- 12 pastry shells (commonly found in grocery freezers under deserts)
- Thyme, black pepper, paprika, to taste

**Bechamel sauce**
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 3 tablespoons flour
- 2 cups milk
- 1/2 finely diced onion

### Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 425°F.
2. Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion, carrots, thyme, paprika, and black pepper. Cook for a few minutes until the vegetables are softened.
3. Add the chicken to the saucepan and stir to coat with the spices. Cook for a few minutes until the chicken is starting to cook.
4. Add the chicken broth to the saucepan and stir to combine. Reduce the heat to low, cover the saucepan, and simmer for 30-35 minutes. Season with salt to taste.
5. Meanwhile, bake the puff pastry shells in the preheated oven for 18-20 minutes or until golden brown.
6. Melt the butter in a separate saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until translucent. Add the flour and whisk to combine. Cook for 1-2 minutes until the mixture turns light brown in color.
7. Gradually whisk in the milk, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat and continue whisking until the sauce thickens. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.
8. Combine the cooked chicken mixture and the bechamel sauce in the same saucepan.
9. Remove the tops of the puff pastry shells and fill them with the chicken mixture. Replace the tops of the shells and bake for an additional 10 minutes until heated through.
10. Broil the vol-au-vents for an additional 1-2 minutes for extra crispiness. Garnish with any leftover chicken mixture and serve hot.

Bon appétit!

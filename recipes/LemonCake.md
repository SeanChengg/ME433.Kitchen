This recipe is a family favorite. If you like lemon, you'll love this cake!

***

### For the cake:

1 cup butter, softened
2 cups sugar
2 cups cake flour
3 teaspoons baking powder
½ teaspoon salt
4 eggs
1 cup milk
1 teaspoon vanilla
½ teaspoon almond extract

### For the lemon cream cheese frosting:

12 oz cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup butter, softened
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
1-16 oz package powdered sugar
2 t lemon zest

### Directions

For the cake, preheat the oven to 350F. Butter and flour 3-9” cake pans (or 1 rectangular pan). Cream butter gradually adding sugar. Cream until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beat after each addition. In separate bowl, sift flour, salt and baking powder. Add flour mixture alternately with milk and flavorings. Beat after each addition until smooth. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes. Cool in pans 10 minutes. For sheet cake, bake 35 to 40 minutes.

For the frosting, beat cream cheese and butter at medium speed with an electric mixer until creamy. Add lemon juice, beating just until blended. Gradually add powdered sugar, beating at low speed until blended. Stir in lemon zest. I usually use a little more powdered sugar, but the frosting is supposed to be soft.

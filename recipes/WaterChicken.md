My good friend in college really likes to chicken and introduced this recipe to me. I found it culturally significant so I am sharing this recipe here.

### Ingredients
- 2 chicken breasts
- 5 cups of water
- salt and pepper to taste

### Instructions
1. Put water in a pot big enough to contain all the water and the chicken.
2. Bring the water into a rolling boil and place your chicken into the water.
3. Boil for 15 mins, then drain and place on your plate.
4. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
5. Enjoy!

Enjoy!

# Pav Bhaji
Pav Bhaji is a famous Indian street food offering and my favourite comfort food. It is cheap and extremely flavourful, so naturally, it has gotten gentrified. 
Nowadays you can get versions with cheese, chips, etc. (My ancestors shudder in their graves...)
Pav bhaji is also extremely versatile and customised to your tastes! Add any leftover veggies and adjust the spice to your liking.

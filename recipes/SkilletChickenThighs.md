This is my go-to when I've got a little extra time to cook. Can't beat the crispy chicken thighs.

### Ingredients
- 1 lb chicken thighs (skin on is best for crispiness, but any version works)
- 1/2 tablespoon salt
- 1/4 tablespoon pepper
- 3 cloves minced garlic
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon avocado oil
- 3 tablespoons butter



### Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 350F.
2. Pat dry chicken thighs with paper towel, pour olive oil, crushed salt and pepper over thighs and mix so everybody gets to know each other.
3. Put cast iron skillet on medium high heat and pour avocado oil into pan, allow pan to get hot.
4. Put thighs in skillet (should sizzle), don't touch them for 5 minutes after they're in.
5. After 5-7 minutes, thighs should be golden brown on face down side and easy to flip with tongs.
6. 5-7 minutes on the other side. Then, heat off, butter in and garlic in.
7. Mix butter and garlic to ensure all thighs are soaking some of that deliciousness in.
8. Throw in the oven for 10-12 minutes.
9. Nosh.

Enjoy!

## Mac and Cheese
Elaine Liu (elaineliu141)


### Ingredients
- 8 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni
- ¼ cup salted butter

- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour

- 2 ½ cups milk, or more as needed

- 2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese

- ½ cup finely grated Parmesan cheese

- salt and ground black pepper to taste (Optional)

### Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
2. Make the macaroni and cheese: Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add macaroni and simmer, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; it will finish cooking in the oven. Drain and transfer to the prepared baking dish.
3. melt 1/4 cup butter in a medium skillet over low heat. Whisk in flour and stir until the mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.
4. make the bread crumb topping

Bon Appetit!

I'm a poor guy with not enough time or motivation to cook meat, so eggs became my favorite source of protein
when I started living off campus. Plain eggs quickly got boring, so I played around with various ingredients
until I found a combination I really liked and didn't get tired of. This is a solid meal that costs less than $2 to make.
And yes, I do eat carbs too. 

## Ingredients
- 4 eggs
- Olive oil
- Shredded mozzarella
- Grated parmesan
- Garlic powder
- Onion powder
- Paprika
- Cayenne pepper
- Chili powder
- Italian seasoning
- Chick-fil-A sauce
- Spinach

# Instructions
1. Add a tablespoon of olive oil to the pan and turn the heat on to medium low.
2. Immediately add your eggs directly to the pan. No need to wait for the oil to heat up, nor to beat the eggs separately. 
3. Sprinkle all over with parmesan and a small handful of mozzarella.
4. Add a dash each of the seasonings in no particular order.
5. Squirt Chick-fil-A sauce into the pan for about 1 second. Mix the pan's contents until fairly uniform.
6. Add a large handful of spinach to the pan and mix it in. Let everything cook for about 3-4 minutes until solid but not burnt.
7. Add any sauce you want on top! I like A1 steak sauce, barbecue sauce, or more Chick-fil-A sauce.
8. Enjoy!

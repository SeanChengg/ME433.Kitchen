Sometimes you need a hearty snack on the go. If that's the case, these hard boiled eggs got you covered. 

### Ingredients
- Eggs (as many that can fit in your pot)
- tablespoon salt

### Instructions
1. Place your eggs in a single layer on the bottom of your pot and cover with cold water. The water should be about an inch or so higher than the eggs. 
2. Cover the pot with a lid.
3. Over high heat, bring your eggs to a rolling boil.
4. Remove from heat and let stand in water for 10-12 minutes for large eggs.
5. Drain water and immediately run cold water over eggs until cooled.

Enjoy your fun snack!

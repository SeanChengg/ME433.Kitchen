Have you ever opened your fridge after 6 hours of studying to find that you have virtually nothing left that constitutes a full meal? Well worry no longer because the low cost Undergrad Skillet can be easily concocted from almost any leftover things left in your fridge!
### Ingredients
- Solid things from your fridge 
- Liquid things from your fridge
- Salt, Pepper, or other assorted seasonings to mask the flavor of any expired ingredients

### Instructions
1. Get your skillet of choice nice and hot!
2. Add in olive oil, butter, or your own spit to grease that skillet up real nice.
3. Toss those solid fridge items directly into the skillet with reckless abandon.
4. Use a spatula to give them a quick stir...or flip them using your pan if you're feelin fancy.
5. Pour those liquid fridge items over the solid ones. Make sure to spread them evenly to increase that flavor potential.
6. Grab your seasonings of choice and spice up your skillet until the taste of rotten fridge food is completely unnoticeable.
7. Snag that one clean fork you've got left and get ready for a one way trip to flavor town!!

Enjoy!

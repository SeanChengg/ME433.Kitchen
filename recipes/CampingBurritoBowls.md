by Michael Miller
Cooking time ~1 hr

Easy to make recipe for big groups at home or when on a rugged budget.

## Ingredients
_This recipe is best made for many people (6+) at a time. Only experience can guide you on how much of each ingredient to buy._

- Lettuce
- Tomatoes
- Summer Squash / Zuccini / other vegetables
- Onion
- Garlic
- Cans of Black Beans / Pinto Beans
- Protein (Beef, Chicken, Tofu)
- White Rice (any kind)
- Tortillas
- Green or Red Salsa


## Instructions

Boil water (slightly less that 2 cups water per 1 cup rice), and once it begins to bubble put the rice in, cover the pot, and put heat on low for 20 minutes. Resist the urge to open the pot. After 20 minutes turn heat off and leave it to cook in the steam for 5 minutes without opening the pot.

If using Tofu, wrap it in paper towels and put something heavy on it to squeeze the water out.

Throw Beans in a pot on medium to heat up. Turn to low if they start to cook too much.

Chop up all Onion, Garlic, Tomatoes, and Vegetables. Throw them in a pan and saute for a minute, then add Protein and cook until cooked.

Combine everything in a Tortilla in a bowl with chopped Lettuce and salsa on top.

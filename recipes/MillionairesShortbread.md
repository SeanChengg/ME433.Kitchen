What's better than classic shortbread? Classic shortbread with chocolate and caramel on top <3

### Ingredients
#### Shortbread
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter
- 1/2 cup caster sugar (not the same as powdered sugar)
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
#### Topping
- 14 ounces sweetened condensed milk
- 1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter
- 1/4 cup brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons golden syrup (or honey as an alternative)
- 1 pinch of salt
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- 8 ounces dark chocolate, chopped

### Instructions
#### Shortbread
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease an 8x8 square baking pan.
2. Pulse the caster sugar, flour, salt, and butter in a food processor until combined. Mixture should be pliable and form a dough when pressed.
3. Pour the mixture into the baking pan and press down. Use a fork to prick rows of holes into the shortbread.
4. Bake for 30-35 minutes until golden and firm. Let cool
#### Topping
1. Place the sweetened condensed milk, butter, brown sugar, golden syrup, and salt in a medium saucepan and heat over medium heat until melted, stirring regularly. Simmer until the caramel mixture has thickened, 5-6 minutes. Mixture is done when it reaches 225 degrees F.
2. Remove the mixture from heat and stir in the vanilla extract.
3. Pour the caramel mixture over the prepared shortbread and use a spoon to even it out. Let cool completely.
4. Heat the chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl until melted, stirring occasionally. Pour the melted chocolate over the firmed up caramel and smooth it over. Place in the fridge to cool completely.
#### Eating
1. Cut the Millionaire's Shortbread into squares and commence om nom.

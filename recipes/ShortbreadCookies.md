# Shortbread Cookie Recipe

This is my shortbread cookie recipe that I made in our very own Elder Hall.

## Ingredients

*   1 1/4 cups flour, plus more for the work surface
*   7 tablespoons unsalted butter, cubed and softened
*   1/4 cup powdered sugar
*   2 drops vanilla extract
*   pinch of salt


## Directions

*   Combine the butter and the flour in a large bowl, and rub them together with your hands until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs.
*   Add in the sugar, vanilla, and salt, and continue to mix together with hands.
*   Knead until the dough comes together and is barely crumbly.
*   Roll out the dough to be 1/2 inch thick. Wrap in parchment paper and refrigerate for at least 15 minutes.
*   Remove the dough from the refrigerator and cut into shapes.
*   Bake the cookies for 25 minutes at 275 degrees F.
*   Enjoy :)

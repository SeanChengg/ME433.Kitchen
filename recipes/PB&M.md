You can't go wrong with a PB&M sandwich.

### Ingredients
- 1 bread
- peanut butter
- 1/2 cup of mayonnaise
- 2 tablespoons of oil
- Honey to taste

### Instructions
1. Take your bread and cut it into two roughly equal pieces
2. Using a knife, lather the peanutbutter onto one of the pieces of bread
3. Place mayonnaise on other peice of bread. NOTE this is where I like
to add honey. I often put 3-4 squeezes.
4. Carefully connect both peices of bread such that the mayonnaise and the
peanutbutter are facing each other
5. Heat oil in frying pan

Garnish with a banana or mango

Scallion pancakes are a classic dim sum dish and make a great snack at any time of day.

### Ingredients
Dough
- 300 g All-Purpose Flour
- 4 g Salt
- 4 g White Pepper
- 120 g Water, Boiling
- 60 g Water, Cool

Filling
- 40 g All-Purpose Flour
- 60 g Neutral Oil (Recommended: Vegetable Oil)
- 6 g Salt
- 8 to 10 Green Onions

Dipping Sauce
- Soy Sauce, To Taste
- Sesame Oil, To Taste

### Instructions
Make the Dough
1. Combine flour and salt in a large bowl.
2. Slowly drizzle in hot water and mix with a pair of chopsticks (or a fork).  The dough doesn't have to be fully mixed but the water should be fully absorbed.
3. Slowly drizzle in cold water and continue mixing.  You will see dough flakes start to form.
4. Press the dough together by hand.  Add water in small amounts if needed.
5. Knead the dough for 5 minutes, then let cover and rest for 20 minutes.
6. Knead the dough again for 1 miute until a smooth dough is formed.

Prepare the Filling
1. While the dough is resting, wash and pat dry the green onions.
2. Cut the green onions: first split down the middle, then chop finely into half-moons.
3. Combine the flour, oil, and salt in a small bowl.  Mix until a smooth paste is formed.

Roll the Pancakes
1. Cut the dough into 6 even pieces, and form each piece into a ball.
2. Keep one dough ball out to work on, and cover and set aside the rest.
3. Roll the dough into a thin rectangle, approximately 6"x10", with a rolling pin.
4. Spoon a tablespoon of filling onto the dough and spread evenly with the back of the spoon.  Sprinkle 2 heaping tablespoons of green onions onto the dough.
5. Roll the dough from the 10" side to form a long tube.  Roll the tube to form a round disk, and gently press down with your hand to seal the pancake.
6. Repeat steps 3 through 5 for each dough ball.

Cook the Pancakes
1. Heat a nonstick skillet or cast iron pan over medium-high heat and add enough oil to fully coat the bottom.
2. Once the oil is hot, add a pancake.
3. Let the pancake cook for 2-3 minutes, then flip and cook for another 2-3 minutes.  Both sides should be lightly browned and crisp.
4. Transfer the pancake to a cooling rack or a cutting board.  Once cool, use a pair of scissors to cut into 6-8 pieces.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each pancake, replenishing the oil between each pancake.
6. Transfer all pancakes to a serving platter and serve with a dipping sauce of choice.

Note: Scallion pancakes can also be stored and cooked later.  Stack them, with a layer of parchment paper in between each pancake, and freeze in a Ziploc bag.

Enjoy!

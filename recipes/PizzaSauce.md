I grew up near NYC, so I learned how to make my own pizza sauce from scratch. Makes 2 14 inch pizzas worth.

### Ingredients
- 28oz Can of San Marzano Peeled Tomatoes 
- 1/2 Clove of Garlic
- 1 Tbsp Extra Virgin Olive Oil
- 1/4 Tsp Kosher Salt
- 3 oz Pesto

### Instructions
1. Strain the peeled tomatoes from the sauce 
2. Using a blender or food processor, process the peeled tomatoes to a chunky paste
3. Mince the garlic and add it to the tomato sauce 
4. Add the extra virgin olive oil, pesto, and kosher salt to the sauce, adding more to taste
5. Mix gently until fully combined 
6. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the fridge for 30 minutes or over night 
7. Ladle and spread sauce evenly on pizza dough with minimal sauce in the center (to avoid sag)

Enjoy!

### Ingredients
- 1 duck
- 2 tablespoon fine salt
- 2 tablespoon maltose
- 120 ml hot water
- 1 teaspoon vinegar
- 2 stalks scallions
- 1 head garlic
- 2 apples
- 4 star anise
- 4 bay leaves
- 2 pieces cassia cinnamon
- 3 tablespoon sweet bean sauce
- 1 teaspoon sugar

### Instructions
1. Pat dry the duck with kitchen paper then rub the salt over the skin and the cavity. Leave to rest on the counter for 1 hour.
2. Bring 1 litres of water to a boil, then pour it over the entire duck skin. If there are feather ends on the skin, remove them with a tweezer.
3. Mix maltose with hot water and vinegar until completely dissolved. Brush a layer of the mixture over the duck skin. Leave to rest in the fridge for 1 hour then brush another layer. 
4. Keep the duck refrigerated uncovered for 24 to 48 hours.
5. One hour before roasting, take the duck out of the fridge to bring it back to room temperature. Put all the stuffing ingredients (scallions, garlic, apples, star anise, cassia cinnamon and bay leaves) into the cavity. Use toothpicks or skewers to seal the openings of the cavity.
6. Preheat a conventional oven, to 425F. Leave to cook for 15 minutes.
7. Then lower the temperature to 390F. Use aluminium foil to cover the tip of the wings and the end of the legs. Continue cooking for a further 60 minutes.
8. Take the duck out of the oven and leave it to rest on the counter for 15 minutes before serving with Chinese pancakes, scallions, and cucumbers. 

Enjoy!

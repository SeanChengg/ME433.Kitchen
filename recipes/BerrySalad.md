This is a basic recipe for my favorite salad. I normally top it with grilled chicken, but I've also swapped it for breaded tofu! 

The fruit used also rotates depending on what's affordable/ in season. 

### Ingredients
- Handful of strawberries, washed and quartered 
- Handful of blueberries, washed
- Handful of raspberries, washed
- 4oz container of mandarin oranges
- Feta cheese
- Poppyseed dressing 
- Romaine lettuce, washed
- Handful of spinach, washed
- (Optionals) Protein topping of choice (grilled chicken, tofu, etc), nuts or seeds (sunflower seeds, pecans, etc.), sliced red onion, arugula

### Instructions
1. Remove desired amount of romaine lettuce from the bundle, cut off any remaining stem from the leaves being used.
2. Rip or cut romaine lettuce into bite sized pieces and fill bowl.
3. Remove stems from spinach and add to bowl. 
4. Add berries to bowl. 
5. Drain cup of mandarine oranges and add the fruit to the bowl.
5. Crumble feta cheese and add desired amount to top of bowl. 
6. Top with poppyseed dressing. 
7. (Optional: Add any extra toppings)

Enjoy!

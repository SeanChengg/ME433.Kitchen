# Banana Bread
by Christopher Cravey
Cooking time ~40 min

## Ingredients

Banana Bread:
- 1 and 1/2 cup sugar
- 1 cup sour cream
- 1/2 cup butter, softened
- 2 eggs
- 3 to 4 ripe bananas, mashed 
- 2 tsp. vanilla extract
- 2 cups all purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 3/4 tsp salt

Frosting:
- 1/2 cup butter
- 4 cups powdered sugar
- 1 and 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
- 3 tbsp milk

## Instructions

Heat oven to 375F. Grease and flour a 15x10 inch jelly roll pan. For the bars, in a large bowl, beat together sugar, sour cream, butter, and eggs until creamy. Blend in bananas and vanilla extract. Add flour, baking soda, salt, and blend for 1 minute.

Spread batter evenly into pan. Bake 20 - 25 minutes or until golden brown.

For the frosting, heat butter in a large saucepan over medium heat until boiling. Let butter turn a delicate brown and remove from heat immediately.

Add powdered sugar, vanilla extract and milk. Whisk together until smooth (should be a bit thinner than frosting). Using a spatula, spread the brown butter frosting over the warm bars.

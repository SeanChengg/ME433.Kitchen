My favorite breakfast meal is the Venezuelan dish arepas which uses maize dough, cheese, and butter.

### Ingredients
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into bit-sized pieces
- 1 pound andouille sausage
- 3 small bell peppers
- 2 ribs celery
- 1 jalapeno
- 1 white onion
- 4 cloves garlic
- 14 ounces can crushed tomatoes
- 3 cups chicken stock
- 1 1/2 cups long grain rice
- 2 tablespoons cajun seasoning
- 1 tablespoon thyme
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 pound shrimp
- 1 cup sliced okra
- salt
- garnishes (parsley, green onions)

### Instructions
1. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a stock pot (or a very large, deep sauté pan) over medium-high heat.  Add the chicken and sausage and sauté for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through and the sausage is lightly browned.  Transfer to a clean plate and set aside.
2. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons oil to the stock pot.  Add bell peppers, celery, jalapeño, onion and garlic. Sauté for 6 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onions are softened.
3. Add the crushed tomatoes, chicken stock, rice, Cajun seasoning, thyme, cayenne, bay leaf, and stir to combine.  Continue cooking until the mixture reaches a simmer.  Then reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer for about 25-30 minutes, or until the rice is nearly cooked through, stirring every 5 minutes or so along the way so that the rice does not burn.
4. Add the shrimp, okra, and stir to combine. Continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, until the shrimp are cooked through and pink. Stir in the chicken and sausage, and remove and discard the bay leaf.
5. Taste season the jambalaya with salt, pepper, and additional Cajun seasoning if needed.  (I typically add about 2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.)  Remove from heat.
6. Serve warm with your desired garnishes.  Or refrigerate and store in a sealed container for up to 3 days.

Enjoy!

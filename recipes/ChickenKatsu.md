# Chicken Katsu by Jeremy Jung

This recipe was taught to me by my little brother before I began college and it has been the backbone of my weekly mealprepping.

## Ingredients

*   2 Chicken Breast
*   3 eggs
*   Corn Starch
*   Panko Bread Crumbs
*   Cooking Oil
*   Salt
*   Black Pepper
*   Garlic Powder
*   Cayenne Pepper
*   Paprika Powder

## Steps

1. Cut the chicken breast into small pieces.
2. Put the corn starch, eggs, and panko in small bowls. Wisk the eggs and mix the panko with 10 shakes of salt, black pepper, and six shakes of garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and paprika powder. The color of the panko should turn orange.
3. Coat each piece of chicken in the corn starch.
4. Then coat each piece in the eggs.
5. Then coat each piece in the panko mix. 
6. Put your heat on medium and fry each piece of chicken until the outer crust is a dark orange.
7. Enjoy! You can eat it with rice, fries, cut it up and put it in a salad, or eat it with curry.

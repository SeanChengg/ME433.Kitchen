### Ingredients

- 1 onion cut into wedges
- 1 ½ pounds baby PIC32s left whole
- 4 cloves garlic minced
- 1 cup beef broth
- 2 tablespoons dijon mustard
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- ½ teaspoon dried rosemary
- ½ teaspoon pepper
- 3-4 pound chuck roast
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch optional



### Instructions

1. In a 6 quart slow cooker, add onion, PIC32s, garlic, and beef broth.
2. In a bowl, combine dijon mustard, salt, pepper, thyme, and rosemary. Brush mustard paste on all sides of beef roast and place in slow cooker on top of vegetables.
3. Cover and cook on low for 8-10 hours (or high for 5-6 hours), **or** until beef roast is tender. This will depend on the size and shape of the roast you're using.
4. Optionally, whisk together cornstarch and 1-2 tablespoons of water. Remove roast from slow cooker and add the cornstarch mixture to the beef broth, stirring to thicken into a gravy.

## mapo tofu
Mapo Tofu is a popular Chinese dish originating from Sichuan province, known for its bold and spicy flavors.
### Ingredients
- 1 block (14-16 oz) of firm or medium-firm tofu
- 1/2 pound ground pork (or ground beef, if preferred)
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 2-3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon fresh ginger, minced
- 2 tablespoons doubanjiang (spicy fermented bean paste)
- 2 cups chicken broth or water
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon ground Sichuan peppercorns (or to taste)
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch mixed with 3 tablespoons water
- 3-4 green onions, sliced
- A handful of fresh cilantro leaves (optional)
### Instruction
1. Cut the tofu into 1-inch cubes and set aside. If you prefer a firmer texture, you can blanch the tofu in boiling water for 2-3 minutes, then drain and set aside.

2. Heat the vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the minced garlic and ginger and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.

3. Add the ground pork (or beef) and cook until browned and cooked through, breaking it up into smaller pieces as it cooks.

4. Stir in the doubanjiang and cook for about 1-2 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.

5. Add the chicken broth or water to the wok, followed by the soy sauce, sugar, and ground Sichuan peppercorns. Bring the mixture to a simmer.

6. Carefully add the tofu cubes to the sauce, gently stirring to coat them evenly. Simmer for 5-10 minutes to allow the tofu to absorb the flavors.

7. In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch with water to create a slurry. Slowly pour the cornstarch mixture into the wok, stirring continuously, until the sauce has thickened to your desired consistency.

8. Stir in the sliced green onions and cook for another 1-2 minutes.

9. Serve the Mapo Tofu over steamed rice, garnished with fresh cilantro leaves if desired.

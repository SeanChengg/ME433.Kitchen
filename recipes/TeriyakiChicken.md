## Teriyaki Chicken

### Ingredients

- Chicken breasts: use boneless skinless. Chicken thighs will work great too, just cook a little longer.
- Olive oil: Vegetable oil can be used here as well.
  Low-sodium soy sauce: You can also use 2 1/2 Tbsp standard soy sauce with 1 1/2 Tbsp water.
- Honey: If you donâ€™t have this you can use more brown sugar.
- Brown sugar: I use light brown sugar, dark would be fine or even granulated sugar.
- Rice vinegar: Apple cider vinegar will work well too. Even lemon juice can be used in a pinch.
- Sesame oil: This has a bold flavor, so a little goes a long way. Unrefined peanut oil can be used as well, add extra.
- Ginger: Fresh is best, but if you must 1/2 tsp dried ginger could be used.
- Garlic: Again fresh is better, but 1 tsp dried granulated will work.
- Cornstarch: This helps thicken the sauce so it is critical to the recipe. Arrowroot starch could be substituted.
- Sesame seeds and green onions: Optional garnishes. Add them if preferred.

### Instructions

1. Heat oil in a large non-stick skillet or wok.
2. Add chicken and let cook (giving space between pieces) until slightly browned on bottom then flip chicken pieces over and cook through.
3. While the chicken is cooking whisk together the teriyaki sauce mixture.
4. Pour sauce into the skillet once the chicken is just nearly finished cooking through and let the sauce cook and simmer until thickened.
5. Easy as that! Serve it warm over brown or white rice with steamed veggies.

# Fried Rice

This is how I make fried rice. It's not healthy.

#### Ingredients

*   1 cup of cooked rice
*   A lot of butter, you decide
*   Garlic powder
*   Soy sauce
*   Bacon
*   Some spices (again you decide)

##### Instructions

1.  Melt the butter in a pan
2.  Place fried rice in the pan and mix around for a minute or two
3.  Add soy sauce and mix until you see a noticeable change in color of the rice
4.  Keep adding soy sauce to taste
5.  Add some garlic powder, mix
6.  Add bacon (which you should have cooked)
7.  Add other spices
8.  Keep frying the rice until its crunchy
9.  For the best texture, use rice that was left in the fridge for a couple days

Autumn is a world-renowned chef*, and this "recipe" is one of her clients' all-time favorites.

*Not really

### Ingredients
- 1 egg
- 1 cup fresh shredded spinach (add some kale too if you want to be fancy)
- 1/4 cup shredded cheese of your choice
- Dashes of salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, and other spices as desired
- 2 tbsp flour if you prefer a denser consistency. Skip this for a more omelet-like feel
- Optional: shredded lunchmeat, hot sauce

### Instructions
1. Mix all the ingredients in a bowl. You want a batter-like consistency but not too thick. Try adding milk, buttermilk, flour, more greens, etc to alter the consistency. (Pretty sure mine is different every time)
2. Heat pan on the stove and add some butter or oil
3. Once pan is hot, pour the mixture into the pan and spread flat with a spoon or spatula
4. Cook until underside is firm enough to flip, or longer for a crispier pancake
5. Flip the pancake and let that side cook too
6. Transfer the pancake to a plate
7. Top with more cheese, butter, or hot sauce if desired
8. Take a photo of your pancake
9. Eat the pancake
10. Send the photo of your pancake and your thoughts on how it came out to autumnbasinger@u.northwestern.edu (or just tell me in class)

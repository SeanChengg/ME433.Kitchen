Spanish rice is a great thing to have for any lunch or dinner. It's a side dish that I had a lot in my childhood. This recipe comes from https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/spanish_rice/

### Ingredients
- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (can use up to 1/4 cup)
- 1 onion, finely chopped (about 1 cup)
- 1 garlic clove, minced (about 1 teaspoon)
- 2 cups of medium or long-grain white rice
- 3 cups chicken stock (or vegetable stock for vegetarian version)
- 1 heaping tablespoon tomato paste or 1 cup of diced fresh or cooked tomatoes, strained
- Pinch of dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon salt

### Instructions
1. Brown the rice.
2. Add onion, garlic.
3. Combine broth, tomato, oregano, salt, and browned rice and onions.
4. Combine the rice and broth mixture.
5. Simmer, cover, cook until the rice has absorbed the stock.

Serve and enjoy!

## Rotisserie Chicken Gumbo
> An authentic gumbo made using rotisserie chickens so that you don't have to cook the chicken. Added by Joshua Feist

### Ingredients
- oil
- 1 bell pepper (any color)
- 2 onions
- 1 carrot
- 1 stalk celery
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 rotisserie chicken
- 3/4 pound smoked saussage (e.g. andouille) or tasso (my family generally uses turkey tasso, but you are unlikely to find that outside of Louisiana)
- 1/2 jar dry roux, or make it in the oven following [this recipe](http://catholicfoodie.com/how-to-make-a-dry-roux-in-the-oven) or another recipe. You could also use wet roux.
- Tony Chachare's or other Cajun seasoning
- Benoit's Best Cajun seasoning (which is salt free)
- cooked rice (for serving)

### Instructions
1. Save the drippings from the chicken. Separate the meat from the skin and bones, and put aside the meat. Coursely chop 1 onion, the carrot, and the celery. Combine the chicken skin and bones with the chopped vegetables, the drippings, and the bay leaves. Cover completely with water. Simmer for at least 2 hours. While it simmers, chop the chicken and return it to the refrigerator.
2. After letting it simmer, filter the stock through a strainer into another pot. After it sits for a few minutes, skim off the fat from the stock.
3. Chop the remaining onion, the bell pepper, and the tasso or sausage.
	- If you're using sausage, saute in a little oil for a few minutes, pour off most of the fat, then add begetables and cook until softened (5-10 minutes).
	- If you're using tasso, start by sauteing the vegetables in a tablespoon of oil until softened (5-10 minutes), then add the tasso and saute for a couple more minutes.
4. Add all of the roux to the vegetables and tasso or sausage. Stir to combine well, then add the (defatted) stock. Bring to a simmer, and continue until the roux is mostly dissolved. Don't worry, it eventually does all dissolve.
5. Add tony's according to preference for salt, and Benoit's Best for more flavor. Simmer for about an hour. Add chopped chicken, adjust seasoning, and add more roux if desired. COntinue cooking for 15 minutes or so.
- It's even better reheated the next day.

> Note: 3 chickens makes about 6 quarts of stock, uses 1 1/2 jars roux, 1 tablespoon Tony's, 2 tablespoons Benoit's Best. Maybe a little more Benoit's Best

# Salsa de Chile de Arbol
Had this in Playa del Carmen, Mexico over spring break and fell in love.

## Ingredients

- Dried chiles de arbol, rinsed and stems removed
- 4 tablespoons olive oil
- 1/2 sweet white onion, sliced
- 3 cloves garlic with skin removed
- 1/4 cup of water
- 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil to a frying pan over medium heat.
2. Add the onion and 1/4 teaspoon of salt and saute for 5 minutes.
3. Add the garlic and continue to saute until vegetables are lightly browned (about 3 minutes).
4. Add the chiles de arbol to the pan with 1/4 teaspoon salt.
5. Saute for another 3 minutes until chiles are lightly toasted and the onion and garlic are brown and caramelized (do not burn)
6. Place the sauteed vegetables, water, and vinegar in a blender or food processor.
7. Blend until everything is combined and the peppers are broken down.
8. Add the oil and blend until the mixture is smooth
9. Adjust flavor with salt, vinegar, or additional chile peppers to adjust the heat.

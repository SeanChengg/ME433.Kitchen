### Instructions
1. Cut sausages into small cylindrical pieces.
2. Place sausage slices in frying pan with oil.
3. Shake the pieces with a wooden spoon to ensure they cook evenly and don't burn
4. If you don't have extra fries laying around, pre-heat oven
5. Place fries in oven and cook them until they turn golden.
4. Mix cooked sausages and fries in a plate.

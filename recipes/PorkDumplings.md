## Ingredients

1. 100 (3.5 inch square) wonton wrappers 
2. 1 3/4 pounds ground pork 
3. 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
4. 4 cloves garlic, minced 
5. 2 tablespoons thinly sliced green onion
6. 4 tablespoons soy sauce 
7. 3 tablespoons sesame oil 
8. 1 egg, beaten 
9. 5 cups finely shredded Chinese cabbage 

## Directions 
### Step 1 
In a large bowl, combine the pork, ginger, garlic, green onion, soy sauce, sesame oil, egg and cabbage. Stir until well mixed. 

### Step 2 
Place 1 heaping teaspoon of pork filling onto each wonton skin. Moisten edges with water and fold edges over to form a triangle shape. Roll edges slightly to seal in filling. Set dumplings aside on a lightly floured surface until ready to cook. 

### Step 3 
Steam dumplings in a covered bamboo or metal steamer for about 15 to 20 minutes. Serve immediately. 

Enjoy!!

I like chicken and corn, I am also a big fan of convenience. Hence, this is a go-to recipe for me. 

### Ingredients
- 600g creamed corn
- 3 cups of chicken stock
- 2 chicken breast (add as little or as much as you like.)
- 2 Ramen Noodle Packets 
- Green Onion
- Cilantro

### Instructions
1. Combine the creamed corn and the chicken stock in a saucepan over medium high heat. Bring to a simmer. 
2. Add the chicken and simmer. Stir for 2 minutes (may depend on how much chicken you put).
3. Add the noodles, feel free to add the flavor packed if you want. 
4. Simmer for 4 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through and the noodles are soft. 
5. Chop up the green onion and cilantro, and place it on top of the soup. 
Enjoy!
